   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Criterion
============

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Criterion is a unit-testing tool that will allow you to test your code efficiently.

Introduction
------------

Setup :
~~~~~~~

If you havenâ€™t installed Criterion yet, please download install_criterion.sh from
the intranet, then run it. Criterion will be installed.

What is criterion ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Criterion lets you create a set of tests that will be executed on your code.
Creating a test follows this pattern :

.. code-block:: c

      Test(suite_name, test_name, ...)
      {
      		//tests
      }

The ``suite_name`` must be the name of a set of tests, which will help you know exactly what part of your code fails.
The ``test_name`` is here to help you know which precise test failed, and thus will be usefull to help you debug your code.

Asserts
-------

Asserts are Criterion's way of defining tests to run. You will have to define several assets in order to test every bit of your code.
Let's see an example using Criterion's most basic assert, ``cr_assert``. This asserts takes a condition as a parameter, and the test passes if the condition is true :

.. code-block:: c

      Test(basics, first_test) {
      		cr_assert(1 + 1 == 2);
      }

Here, as one plus one will always be equal to two, the test will always pass.
Let's see the full list of Criterion's asserts.

Basic asserts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. c:macro:: cr_assert(Condition)

Passes if ``condition`` is true.
