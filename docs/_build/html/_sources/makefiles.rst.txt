Makefiles
=========

Introduction
------------

A Makefile is a file, read by the ``Make`` program, which executes all the
commands and rules in the Makefile.

.. tip::
   Remember the first two days of C Pool. You were supposed to use bash and
   build your own aliases and scripts. ``Make`` is kind of a custom build 
   script that makes your programmer-life really easier.

.. attention::
   Hey this is not so cool.

.. caution::
   Worse !

.. danger::
   BAAAD!

.. error::
   This is an..... Segmentation fault (core dumped)

.. hint::
   This is a hint !

.. important::
   This is a national security concern !

.. note::
   This is bluuuuuuuuuuuue.

.. warning::
   ARTCHUNG !

At EPITECH, you'll be using Makefiles to compile your code, using a
``compiler``.
