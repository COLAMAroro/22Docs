Makefiles
=========

Introduction
------------

A Makefile is a file, read by the ``Make`` program, which executes all the
commands and rules in the Makefile.

.. admonition:: Remember
   :class: caution

   Remember the first two days of C Pool. You were supposed to use bash and
   build your own aliases and scripts. ``Make`` is kind of a custom build 
   script that makes your programmer-life really easier.

At EPITECH, you'll be using Makefiles to compile your code, using a
``compiler``.
